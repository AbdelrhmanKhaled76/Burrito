Burrito Website

This website is built using Next.js with TypeScript and React. It represents my second attempt at designing with Figma. The website's styling is implemented with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a modern and responsive design.

For the feedback page form, I developed a RESTful API and utilized Formik for form handling. The Yup library was employed to validate form schemas effectively. The API data is validated using Next.js routes, with data stored and managed in MongoDB.

The logos and color palette used in the website were designed by a friend, contributing to the unique visual identity of the project. Animations throughout the site were implemented using the AOS library, enhancing the user experience.

Additionally, I integrated the Swiper library to create sliders on both the homepage and the about page. The website is fully responsive, leveraging the powerful features of Tailwind CSS.

Feel free to explore the site and experience it yourself!
