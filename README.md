BURRITO WEBSITE

this website is made with next js in addition to typescript with react , this website was the second try for me to design with figma !, the style for this web site is made with tailwind.css !!
i also made a restful api for the feedback page form , in addition to using formik for the form , i used the YUP libirary for validating schemas for the form
i used the next routes to validate the api data for my mongodb , the logos + the pallete used in the website is made by my friend , i used the AOS libirary for the animation used in the website
i used the swiper libirary to make a slider for the home page and the about page , finally the website is responsive using the tailwind features , feel free to see the page yourself !
